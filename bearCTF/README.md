## Steganography

### STEG1 - file: `justanormalpicture.png`

Sometimes, pictures like to express themselves... but how do they talk?
In programming, you know, we communicate through strings. Can pictures do the same? 

### STEG2 - file : `steg.txt`
So many file types, hope I saved my file correctly.

### STEG3 - file : `stegsolve.jpg`
Images in Images, can you find my secret message.

### STEG4 - file : `i_see_things.wav`
Yesterday, I chose to see music. Listening to it is too mainstream.

### STEG5 - file : `mix_of_things.wav`
I was trying to send a secret message to my friend, but I may have confused myself... 

`note` : " / " are spaces. 

### STEG6 - file : `crossword.jpg`
Left to right line by line and the password you shall find.

### STEG7 - file : `arrow.jpg`
`note` : flag is single string not in bearCTF{} format


## General

### files: `Thing1.txt` , `Thing2.txt`
We know Thing1 and Thing2 look about the same
But deep inside they are different
They are both insane.



## Forensics
### Forensics1 - file : `whitepages.txt` - this is from picoCTF2019
I stopped using YellowPages and moved onto WhitePages... but the page they gave me is all blank!

### Forensics2
For this challenge, you need to connect to our little server. The file will be in there :
### ` ssh bear@34.201.166.179 ` | password: bearCTF
### Directory: Forensics | file: `haha.txt`
Can you find the flag in file? This would be really tedious to look through manually, something tells me there is a better way.



### Forensics3 - file : `forensics_shark.pcapng` 
My message was broken in different parts. Can you put it together? 



## Exploitation
For these challenges, you need to connect to our little server. The file will be in there :
### ` ssh bear@34.201.166.179 ` | password: bearCTF


### EX1 Directory: Exploitation/EX1 | file: `vuln`
Can you tell me how many bytes it takes to crash the program?

### EX2 Directory: Exploitation/EX2 | file: `store`
Can you buy the flag from the store?
